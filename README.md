# Wake

The whole area is black, the only thing that can be heard is the beeping of an oxygen machine.

A spotlight comes up on a simple hospital room. 

One of the siblings is lying in a hospital bed with an IV in one arm and oxygen tube running under their nose. 

The second is sitting on a chair beside them holding their unconscious siblings hand.

They gently lay their head on the bed, still holding hands and slip into a deep slumber.

The light flickers out to darkness and the final beep from the machine echoes out into the darkness.
